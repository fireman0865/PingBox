![NetBox](docs/netbox_logo.svg "NetBox logo")

NetBox is an IP address management (IPAM) and data center infrastructure
management (DCIM) tool. Initially conceived by the network engineering team at
[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), NetBox was developed specifically
to address the needs of network and infrastructure engineers. It is intended to
function as a domain-specific source of truth for network operations.

NetBox runs as a web application atop the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
Python framework with a [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) database. For a
complete list of requirements, see `requirements.txt`. The code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox).

The complete documentation for NetBox can be found at [Read the Docs](http://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
